# Memepool

This project is meant to allow you to create a custom mempool instead of using bitcoind's.

## TODO

- [ ] Transaction Validation
- [ ] Removing mined transactions
- [ ] Basic Transaction replacement
- [ ] Standardness Rules
- [ ] Fee estimation
- [ ] Block Templates
- [ ] Nostr?

## Future

Eventually this would be cool to be a playground for different mempool rules and is easier to change than bitcoin core.
