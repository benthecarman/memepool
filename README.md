# Memepool

A bitcoin mempool with blackjack and hookers!

## Goals

This project is meant to allow you to create a custom mempool instead of using bitcoind's.
This is to get around bitcoind's arbitrary rules and allow you to test out different mempool rules.
Memepool still communicates of the native bitcoin p2p network and can be used with bitcoind.

## TODO

- [ ] Transaction Validation
- [ ] Removing mined transactions
- [ ] Basic Transaction replacement
- [ ] Standardness Rules
- [ ] Fee estimation
- [ ] Block Templates
- [ ] Nostr?

## Future

Eventually this would be cool to be a playground for different mempool rules and is easier to change than bitcoin core.
